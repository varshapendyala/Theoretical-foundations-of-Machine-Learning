# Theoretical-foundations-of-Machine-Learning

Following work was as part of my course project for the course [ECE/CS 861](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/cs861.html) at UW, Madison.

In this work I study the problem of adversarial perturbations to rewards, in a Multi-armed bandit (MAB) setting. Specifically, I focus on an adversarial attack to a UCB type best-arm identification policy applied to a stochastic MAB.
